# Image_Cartoonify

## AIM: 
The purpose of this project is to Cartoonify an image i.e. to display an image in a cartoon form

## Working:
The cartoon image conatains two basic elements in it:
1. The boundary of the image object
2. The color of the image

To do this we are using the following image:

In the next step we create an image containg the boundaries/ edges of the inage after converting it into a grayscale image:

Then we make a smoothened image of the original color image:

In the final step, we merge the smoothened and the edged image so as toobtain the cartoonified image, which is the desired output:
